In these challange I learned lot of things that are in the frontend development some of which  I learned in most simple and proper way are:

1. I want to include most amazing thing I learned in these challange is to use the position property.

3. In these challange I learned how to use flexbox and make section or layouts using it and also how we can manage positions of certain elements using it.

There are some concepts which I'm not comfortable while doing still I'm not making things well such as flexbox, grid, positions and making responsive designs.
