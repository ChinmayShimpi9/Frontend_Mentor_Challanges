### The challenge

In these challange we are free to use flexbox or grid or all the other properties and the challange is simple to create the [Product Review Card Component].
Which includes two sections of card in which one section will display the whole image of the product, second section wil display product details and all.
In that you need to give status wise css and when you hover on it, like the button should glow when you hover on it.

## My process

1. Firstly, I watched the challange given to me in the frontend challange resources.
2. They provided the fonts, colors, desings and images and all the necessary assets that are required to complete the challange.
3. Then I overview all the assets they  given and started planning the challange.
4. First I create a folders which includes all the assets and all to complete the challange.
5. Then after that I create html structure  and started making the project and while watching the challange.
6. I learned a lot things about html and css and how you can improve it.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid


### What I learned

In these challange I learned lot of things that are in the frontend development some of which  I learned in most simple and proper way are:

1. I want to include most amazing thing I learned in these challange is to create the split screen inside the card using the Grid.
2. Also I use how to Center a div how You can play with it using the css grid property.


## Some of my favourite code I written from these challange:

```css
.grid {
  max-width: 600px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 15px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.img img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: inherit;
}

These css help me to make two section in which first section will display the whole image of the product, second section wil display product details and all using the css grid property which will help in making the design in very simple and is same like the challange in most of the perfect manner also I'm simple able to manage all the elements in these section with proper style.
```

### Continued development

There are some concepts which I'm not comfortable while doing still I'm not making things well such as flexbox, grid, positions and making responsive designs.
