### The challenge

In these challange we are free to use flexbox or grid or all the other properties and the challange is simple to create the [3 Column Preview Card Component].
Which includes three sections of card in which each section will display the car type image, its type name, some info about that type of car and lastly the cta button to know more about the more information.
In that you need to give status wise css and when you hover on it, like the button should glow when you hover on it.
