### The challenge

In these challange we are free to use flexbox or grid or all the other properties and the challange is simple to create the [Results summary component].

Which includes two sections of card in which one section will display the result and other will display the summary of overall results.

In that you need to give status wise css and when you hover on it, like the button should glow when you hover on it.

## My process

1. Firstly, I watched the challange given to me in the frontend challange resources.
2. They provided the fonts, colors, desings and images and all the necessary assets that are required to complete the challange.
3. Then I overview all the assets they  given and started planning the challange.
4. First I create a folders which includes all the assets and all to complete the challange.
5. Then after that I create html structure  and started making the project and while making the challange.
6. I learned a lot things about html and css and how you can improve it.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In these challange I learned lot of things that are in the frontend development some of which  I learned in most simple and proper way are:

1. How to use the gradient using the css property.
2. Also I want to include most amazing thing I learned in these challange is to create the split screen inside the card using the flexbox.
3. Also I use how to Center a div how You can play with it using the css flexbox property.


## Some of my favourite code I written from these challange:

```html
<div class="score-reaction">
  <div class="score-con">
    <img src="./images/icon-reaction.svg" alt="reaction" />
    <span>Reaction</span>
  </div>
</div>

while making the summary section, these html code help to manage all the things in the div and in that use images and paragraphs and all the things and it helped very much in doing the css on these part it makes it very much easy.
```

```css
.score-left {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 50px;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  border-radius: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
}

These css help me to make the left section of the card very simple and is same like the challange in most of the perfect manner also I'm simple able to manage all the elements in these section with proper style.
```

### Continued development

There are some concepts which I'm not comfortable while doing still I'm not making things well such as flexbox, grid, positions and making responsive designs.
